Slider Values
1. Gaussian Blur
cv2.GaussianBlur(inputImage, (ksize, ksize), signmaX)
ksize: a Size object representing the size of the kernel; range: 3-9
SigmaX: A variable of the type double representing the Gaussian kernel standard deviation in X direction; range 0-3 (include decimal values)

2. Brightness and Contrast Control
alpha: contrast control; 1.0 means no change; greater than 1 increases the contrast; 0-1 decreases contrast (include decimal values)
beta: brightness control; 0 means no change; positive number increase brightness; range -127 to 127

3. Canny Edge Detection
cv2. Canny(inputImage, threshold1, threshold2)
threshold1: minVal; range: 0-100
threshold2: maxVal; range: 0-100
(Any edges with intensity gradient more than maxVal are sure to be edges and those below minVal are sure to be non-edges, so discarded)

4. Hough Circle Transform:
dp: resoluton of the accumulator, smaller dp means more accurate accumulator but increases computational load (usual value are 1 and 2) 
minDist: minimum distance between the centers of the detected circles; range: 0-20
param1: upper threshold for Canny Edge Detection, any gradient value higher than the threshold is considered an edge; range: 1-200
param2: accumulartor threshold for the circle centers at the detection stage, determines the minimum bnumber of votes a candidate circle must receive to be considered a circle; range: 1-100 
minRadius: minimum circle radius; range: 0-20
maxRadius: maximun circle radius; range: 0-20
